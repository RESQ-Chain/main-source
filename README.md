What is Renesis?
----------------

Renesis is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Renesis uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Renesis Wallet is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency. Renesis is also the name of its
algorithm with v2 Renesis called Renesis XT hash. To continue with the ASIC 
resistance promise, Renesis Project will implement the Renesis XT hash when it is
needed.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Renesis Wallet software, see https://github.com/renesisgroup/wallets, or read the
[Renesis whitepaper](http://github.com/renesisgroup/whitepaper/RENESIS-paper.pdf).
